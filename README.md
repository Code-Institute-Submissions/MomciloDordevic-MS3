### Project Goals

The primary goal of **Pizza Lovers** is to allow the users to create, save, search, and view their favorite pizza recipes in one place using  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, Flask, and MongoDB.

- Use the CRUD conventions to:
    - Create a recipe
    - Read recipe
    - Update(Edit) recipe
    - Delete recipe they created
- Be able to search the database for recipes with keywords that query Recipe Names, Ingredients and Alergens.
